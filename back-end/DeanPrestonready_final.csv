- Stabilization of Rent: By subjecting these units to rent control, the policy aims to stabilize rent increases for tenants, ensuring that they are not subjected to sudden and unaffordable hikes in rent prices. 
- Enhanced Legal Protections: The clarification of existing law regarding rent control exemptions under Costa-Hawkins could enhance legal protections for tenants, closing potential loopholes that landlords may exploit to the detriment of tenants.
