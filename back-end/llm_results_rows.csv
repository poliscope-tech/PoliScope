- Accessibility and Allocation: The process for accessing affordable housing may become more flexible for projects approved prior to November 1, 2023, and that receive a first construction document within a specified period.
- Affordability Sustainability: There may be concerns about the long-term sustainability of affordability for the units affected by the reduced requirements.

Based on the information provided, the impact on affordable housing development seems to be mixed. The reduction in requirements may streamline the process for some projects but could potentially result in fewer affordable units being created overall.
